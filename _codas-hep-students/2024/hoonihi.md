## My research:
Electron scattering and transport in condensed matter, especially in liquid water at elevated temperature

## My expertise is:
Scientific computing, Python, Monte Carlo methods

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Analyzing sensitivity on various parameters affect scattering characteristics of electrons

## I've got my eyes on:
More convenient and efficient tools

## I want to know more about:
ML techniques that can be applied to stochastic modeling in radiation chemistry
